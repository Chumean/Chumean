Hi again! I'm David, a software engineer with a flair for creativity and a background as diverse as my coding interests. I graduated from Stockton in 2017 and honed my skills at App Academy in 2023. During my coding journey, I solo-designed an online game store and collaborated on a group project, bringing an e-groceries shop to life. These experiences taught me the art of problem-solving, and I now see coding as a series of puzzles waiting to be solved. There's nothing quite like the feeling of making things work! In the fast-paced world of tech, I've fallen in love with learning new skills. Whether it's diving into the intricacies of JavaScript or mastering the elegance of Python, I'm always up for a challenge. My bootcamp experience revealed my love/hate relationship with creating comments and reviews for websites. Crafting thoughtful insights brings me joy, while CSS sometimes tests my patience.
